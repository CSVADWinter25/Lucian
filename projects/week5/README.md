## Project 5 Readme

For the project, I modified the cube example. The parameters were size in the X,Y,Z direction. I added a division parameter for every axis to make the shape complex on every face. I changed it to be wireframe. I constrained the object to 20 divisions. I attempted to make multiple instances of it with a class but it didn't work out.
